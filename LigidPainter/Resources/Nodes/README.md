# Nodes Of The LigidPainter

LigidPainter loads these node files to generate its nodes.

You can add your own node file or modiy the existing node file.
(Ramp.node is an unique file. Modifying is not suggested)

Importer header can be found at /LigidPainter/Main/src/Core/ProcessTheNodeFile.hpp (is written poorly)
